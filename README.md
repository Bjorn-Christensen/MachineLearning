  <p>Welcome to my Machine Learning showcase. This repository includes upload of my various ML projects, associated research, findings, and various demos applying my work to real life scenarios. In addition to completed works, this repo will also include templates and tutorials on foundational applied-ML and data-science practices.</p>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I recommend checking out the Object Detection projects first, as those are the most visually appealing and easy to follow. Any works found within the Templates and Tutorials folders will be made with the intention of implementing an easy-to-follow guide complete with diagrams and personal notes. All ML works completed during my studies are stored within the Undergraduate Research folder. Each of the projects within this folder have an associated in-depth report which outlines the purpose, hypotheses, and findings.
