This is a simple project to test and remind myself of methods used in finetuning pretrained models.
I did not run the finetuning to create an optimally trained model, however I was still able to see very solid results after only a few epochs.
Most of this code runs on the assumption that one is using Google Colab and CUDA, however it does include CPU code variations in the comments.
