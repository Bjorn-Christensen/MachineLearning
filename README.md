  <p>Welcome to my Machine Learning showcase. This repository includes upload of my various ML projects, associated research, findings, and various demos applying my work to real life scenarios. In addition to completed works, this repo will also include templates and tutorials on foundational applied-ML and data-science practices.</p>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

In an effort to showcase my work and research with Machine Learning and to create a repository from which I can receive relevant templates and tutorials, I have created this portfolio piece. All works are sorted by a generalization of their shared goal or models. For example, I have grouped all projects that make use of CNN implementations in the folder `Object Detection`. Larger or more flushed out projects may their own dedicated folder, such as the `MTG_Library`. All projects, templates, and tutorials stored within this repository are my own work or research I have completed with a team.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I recommend checking out the `Object Detection` projects first, as those are the most visually appealing and easy to follow. Any works found within the Templates and Tutorials folders will be made with the intention of implementing an easy-to-follow guide complete with diagrams and personal notes. All ML works completed during my studies are stored within the Undergraduate Research folder. Each of the projects within this folder have an associated in-depth report which outlines the purpose, hypotheses, and findings.
